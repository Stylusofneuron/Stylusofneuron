# Hi I am stylusofneuron
I am an aspiring neuroscientist. My goal is to understand brain by using bioogical and computational methods. 
I want to contribute to the opensource society by sharing my inventions and knowledge.
I hope I will be able to programme and make automatas that will help people who shares my will, whom I consider to be the humans who are closest to me.
This repository will contain my life's works and yeah I hope many of my fellows will return the favour by contributing and living their lives a bit better because of me.
I want to be an important member of this family by the end of my time and bring smile on many of my fellow humans :)
